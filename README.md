Documentation:

This project aimed to create an application that streamlines the process of generating surveys and consent requests. My primary focus was on frontend development, where I worked intensively with Angular to create a user interface that was both simple and easy to navigate. Unfortunately, due to the limited time frame, I was unable to add any visual enhancements to the interface, but I dedicated significant effort to ensuring its functionality.

Throughout the project, I also contributed to other aspects wherever possible, including backend development and API implementation. Collaboration and flexibility were crucial to the project's success, and I eagerly took on tasks outside my primary role to support the team.
